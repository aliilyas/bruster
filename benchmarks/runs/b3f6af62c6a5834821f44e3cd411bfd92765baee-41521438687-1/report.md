Ten sessions per configuration by default, with rotating order and fresh browser profiles. Values are medians [observed minimum–maximum], not confidence intervals. Startup and first navigation have one sample per session; repeated-operation timings pool all iterations; memory uses the median of three idle readings per session. Startup includes adapter/daemon/server initialization and blank-page/viewport setup. The combined launch-to-first-page measurement includes both setup and the first navigation. Xvfb is already running: its startup time is excluded, but its memory is included. 1280×800 viewport; localhost fixtures; no-store HTTP responses; navigation waits for load. OS filesystem caches are not flushed. Identical extraction JavaScript and cross-tool result hashes. Timings include controller round trips and per-command CLI launches. These deterministic workloads do not measure LLM inference or token efficiency. Memory covers the complete owned process forest (including detached daemons and helpers), plus Xvfb for Bruster. PSS apportions shared pages; summed RSS double-counts them. Memory is small-page idle usage, not peak usage. Native snapshots have different semantics and are retained in the raw artifacts rather than ranked as equal work. MB = 1,000,000 bytes; MiB = 1,048,576 bytes. Installed-file inventories are lower bounds including browser/engine, linked libraries, observed mapped files and Node where required; unobserved OS resources may add more. GitHub-hosted runner hardware and OS packages can change: compare the configurations within a run and inspect provenance before interpreting trends.

| [Puppeteer / full Chrome](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer)  | Measured in this run | Existing baseline; not named in the linked HN thread. |
| [agent-browser / full Chrome](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser) [HN comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=49763636) [HN comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=49784241) | Measured in this run | Native CLI and persistent daemon; per-command CLI overhead included. |
| [Stagehand / full Chrome](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand) [HN comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=49756672) | Measured in this run | Local v4 SDK and bundled extension; deterministic Page APIs. No LLM calls, act/extract inference, cloud caching, or token-efficiency claims. |
| [browse.sh / full Chrome](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/tree/main/packages/cli) [HN comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=49784241) | Measured in this run | Local browse CLI, Stagehand extension and persistent daemon; per-command Node CLI overhead included. Same monorepo as Stagehand. |
| [Playwright MCP / full Chrome](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) [HN comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=49756672) | Measured in this run | Actual stdio MCP server and tool calls, including default response snapshots and client/server overhead; navigation explicitly waits for load. |
| [SleepyHollow / Apple WebKit](https://github.com/bensyverson/sleepyhollow) [HN comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=49762455) [HN comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=49767052) | macos-timing | Separate same-Mac Bruster/SleepyHollow timing job and artifact. Requires macOS 12+ and WebKit.framework. No Linux/PSS or runtime-footprint estimates; native validation requires the macOS workflow. |
| [Cypress / Chrome test runner](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress) [HN comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=49766482) [HN comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=49773778) | Measured in this run | Real Cypress CLI/spec runner, application iframe, proxy and task IPC; one command per test with test isolation and retries disabled. Runner, bundled Electron runtime and owned Xvfb are counted. Native snapshot is unavailable; shared DOM extraction is measured. |
| [Ui.Vision MCP / browser extension](https://github.com/A9T9/RPA/tree/master/mcp) [HN comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=49765724) | Measured in this run | Official browser extension and real MCP bridge in an isolated headless Chrome profile with an open panel. Playwright provisions/closes the browser; measured operations use MCP. Macro-log extraction is chunked to respect transport limits; all calls and default response snapshots are counted. Native snapshots can truncate at 60,000 characters; shared extraction is complete. |
| [Rustwright / full Chrome](https://github.com/Skyvern-AI/rustwright) [HN story](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=48923788) [HN story](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=48932230) [HN story](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=49319583) | Measured in this run | User-requested addition, verified against separate HN stories identifying Skyvern-AI/rustwright. Public Node SDK over its in-process Rust CDP engine. The experimental Node API lacks a viewport setter: a CDP connection provisions the viewport at startup and remains idle in memory scope. All workload operations use the SDK. Native snapshot is unavailable in the Node SDK. |
| [Rustwright MCP / full Chrome](https://github.com/Skyvern-AI/rustwright/tree/main/mcp) [HN story](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=48923788) [HN story](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=48932230) [HN story](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=49319583) | Measured in this run | User confirmed that 'Rust MCP' means Rustwright MCP. Canonical native Rust stdio MCP server, launched directly from its official npm binary package. MCP client/server and automatic snapshots are counted; navigation explicitly waits for load. Native snapshots can truncate; shared extraction is complete. Distinct from the deprecated Python server and luka-loehr/browser-rs. |
| [Biloba / full Chrome](https://github.com/onsi/biloba) [HN story](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=49699819) | Measured in this run | User-requested addition, verified against its separate Show HN story. Public TypeScript SDK and real bilobad Go daemon over chromedp; a fresh local browser and session per round. Measures serial browser operations, including daemon transport; no Vitest/Ginkgo scheduling or parallel-suite claims. Native accessibility outlines can truncate; shared extraction is complete. |
